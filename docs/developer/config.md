# Configuration

Neo loads the first available config:

1. `./neo.yaml`
2. `~/.neo/config.yaml`
3. Embedded defaults from `internal/config/defaults/neo.yaml`

First hit wins. Config files are not merged.

## Default Config

This is the complete configuration surface. Copy it to `~/.neo/config.yaml` or
`./neo.yaml` and change only the values you need.

```yaml
# LLM backend: anthropic, openai, openrouter, or google.
provider: anthropic

# OpenAI only: api_key uses OPENAI_API_KEY; subscription uses `neo login`.
# openai_auth: api_key

model: claude-opus-4-8

# Optional. When omitted, subagents follow the active provider and model.
# subagents:
#   provider: anthropic
#   model: <claude-model-id>

permissions:
  mode: trusted # trusted, ask, or readonly

# Transcripts compact at 70% of this estimate.
compaction:
  context_window_tokens: 200000

features:
  agents_file: true
  skills: true
  prompt_caching: true

output:
  verbose: false
```

The embedded source, including annotated provider examples, is
[`internal/config/defaults/neo.yaml`](https://github.com/owainlewis/neo/blob/main/internal/config/defaults/neo.yaml).

## Provider Selection

| Config | Auth source | Provider adapter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider: anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `internal/llm/anthropic` |
| `provider: openai` with `openai_auth: api_key` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `internal/llm/openai.Client` |
| `provider: openai` with `openai_auth: subscription` | ChatGPT/Codex device-code credentials from `~/.neo/auth.json` | `internal/llm/openai.CodexClient` |
| `provider: openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `internal/llm/openrouter` |
| `provider: google` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `internal/llm/google` |

Subscription credentials are created with `neo login` and removed with `neo logout`. The docs describe only where credentials live and which flow uses them; token values are never generated into developer docs.

The top-level `provider` selects the backend for a session. In the TUI, `/model` lists models for that provider and switches the model and compactor for the current session without rewriting configuration. Start a new session with a different `provider` value to change backends.

## Feature Flags

Each feature flag is tri-state in Go: absent means use the built-in default, while explicit `false` disables that capability.

| Flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agents_file` | `true` | Load AGENTS.md into the chat system prompt. |
| `skills` | `true` | Discover skills and expand $name references or /name slash invocations. |
| `prompt_caching` | `true` | Mark the stable system prompt prefix as cacheable when the provider supports it. |

## Output

`output.verbose` is tri-state, same as feature flags: absent or `false` means concise mode (the default).

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `output.verbose: false` | (default) | Show live in-flight activity and concise completed receipts (e.g. a file read or command run). Errors, failures, and direct `!` command output always render in full. |
| `output.verbose: true` | | Restore full tool call/result cards, including complete file contents and command output. |

## Permissions

`permissions.mode` defaults to `trusted`.

| Mode | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `trusted` | Allow built-in tools; ask before high-risk bash commands; deny path-shaped file tools outside the repo root. |
| `ask` | Allow read/search tools inside the repo root; ask before bash and file mutations. |
| `readonly` | Allow read/search tools only; deny bash and file mutations. |
